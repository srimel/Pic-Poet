Media Space Link:
https://media.pdx.edu/media/t/1_2r94k3up

Note: at the time of generating the media space Link
the site doesn't seem to be playing any of my videos
that I have uploaded to it. So I've enabled downloads
on the screencast just incase the grader experiences 
this as well they can attempt to download the video
to play it. 

Let me know if you can't download or otherwise play 
the video.

Thanks!
